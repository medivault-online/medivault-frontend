# Error Handling Audit Checklist

Use this checklist to review and standardize error handling across components in the medical imaging application.

## Component Audit Checklist

For each component that interacts with the API or performs data operations:

### 1. State Management

- [ ] Component has a `loading` state variable
- [ ] Component has an `error` state variable (string or null)
- [ ] For forms, component has a `submitting`/`saving` state variable
- [ ] For forms, component has a `validationErrors` state variable (object)

### 2. Data Fetching Functions

- [ ] Function sets loading state at the beginning
- [ ] Function clears error state at the beginning
- [ ] Function uses try/catch/finally pattern
- [ ] Function checks API response status properly
- [ ] Function handles errors with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Function logs errors to console
- [ ] Function always resets loading state in finally block
- [ ] Function provides fallback/empty data when appropriate

### 3. Form Submission Functions

- [ ] Form validates inputs before submission
- [ ] Function sets submitting/saving state
- [ ] Function clears error state at the beginning
- [ ] Function uses try/catch/finally pattern
- [ ] Function checks API response status
- [ ] Function provides success feedback (toast notification)
- [ ] Function resets submitting state in finally block

### 4. User Feedback

- [ ] Uses toast notifications for errors (`toast.showError`)
- [ ] Uses toast notifications for success (`toast.showSuccess`)
- [ ] Displays inline error messages where appropriate
- [ ] Provides visual loading indicators during operations
- [ ] Disables buttons/controls during loading
- [ ] Provides retry mechanisms when operations fail

### 5. Loading States

- [ ] Initial data load shows appropriate loading indicator
- [ ] Partial updates show appropriate loading indicators
- [ ] Empty states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Skeleton loaders used where appropriate for better UX

## Common Issues to Look For

- [ ] Missing loading states
- [ ] Inconsistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Not checking API response status
- [ ] Not providing user feedback on errors
- [ ] Not resetting loading states
- [ ] Using alert() instead of toast notifications
- [ ] Throwing errors without catch blocks
- [ ] Not providing fallback UI when data is unavailable
- [ ] Not disabling interactive elements during loading

## Component-Specific Considerations

### Patient-Related Components

- [ ] Handle patient not found errors
- [ ] Provide appropriate privacy messaging for unauthorized access
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data errors don't reveal PHI

### Image Processing Components

- [ ] Handle large file upload errors
- [ ] Provide progress indicators for uploads
- [ ] Handle image processing failures gracefully
- [ ] Provide alternative viewing options if primary fails

### Appointment Components

- [ ] Handle scheduling conflicts
- [ ] Provide clear feedback on availability issues
- [ ] Handle timezone-related errors

## Implementation Process

1. Identify all components that make API calls
2. Apply this checklist to each component
3. Update components to follow the standardized patterns
4. Test error scenarios to ensure proper handling
5. Document any special error handling cases

## Priority Components for Review

These components have been identified as high priority for error handling standardization:

1. ProviderCalendar
2. AppointmentList
3. PatientDetailsPage
4. ImageUpload
5. ImageViewer
6. AnalysisPage
7. AdminSettingsPage
8. UserManagement
9. PatientRecordsPage
10. MessageCenter
