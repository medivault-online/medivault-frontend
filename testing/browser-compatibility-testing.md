# Browser Compatibility Testing Plan

## Target Browsers and Devices

### Desktop Browsers
- Google Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Microsoft Edge (latest 2 versions)

### Mobile Browsers
- iOS Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Android Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Samsung Internet (latest version)

### Screen Sizes and Resolutions
- Mobile: 320px - 480px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1024px - 1920px
- Large Desktop: > 1920px

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
1. Configure and run Playwright or Cypress tests across multiple browsers
2. Set up responsive design tests using viewport resizing
3. Implement visual regression testing to catch UI inconsistencies

### Manual Testing
1. Perform manual testing on real devices for critical user journeys
2. Test touch interactions on mobile and tablet devices
3. Verify form behaviors and validation across browsers
4. Test image upload and viewing functionality on all browsers
5. Verify that appointments can be booked and managed on all supported platforms

## Test Cases

### Authentication Flow
- User registration renders correctly on all screen sizes
- Login form works across all browsers
- Password reset flow functions consistently

### Navigation and Layout
- Navigation menu is accessible on all screen sizes
- Responsive design breakpoints work correctly
- Content layouts adjust appropriately for different viewports
- No horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
- Touch targets are appropriately sized on mobile

### Appointment Management
- Provider selection works on all browsers and devices
- Date picker is functional and visually consistent
- Time slot selection is usable on touch devices
- Form submission works consistently
- Error messages display correctly

### Medical Image Handling
- Image upload works on all browsers
- Image viewer renders correctly
- Image controls (zoom, pan) work on desktop and touch devices
- Image analysis results display consistently

### Performance Considerations
- Initial load time is reasonable across devices
- Animations and transitions are smooth
- No layout shifts during page load
- Acceptable performance on lower-end mobile devices

## Testing Tools

### Browser Tools
- Chrome DevTools for responsive design testing
- Firefox Responsive Design Mode
- Safari Web Inspector
- Edge DevTools

### Cross-Browser Testing Services
- BrowserStack
- LambdaTest
- Sauce Labs

### Performance Testing
- Lighthouse audits for performance, accessibility, and best practices
- WebPageTest for detailed performance analysis

## Testing Workflow

1. Develop features with Chrome DevTools responsive mode
2. Run automated tests across browsers for each feature
3. Perform manual testing on at least one mobile and one desktop browser
4. Address any browser-specific issues
5. Run final cross-browser tests before deployment
6. Document any known browser-specific limitations

## Reporting and Documentation

- Document browser-specific issues in the project repository
- Include browser compatibility information in release notes
- Maintain a compatibility matrix showing supported features across browsers
- Track browser usage statistics to prioritize future compatibility efforts

## Accessibility Considerations

- Test screen reader compatibility across browsers
- Verify keyboard navigation works on all browsers
- Check color contrast and text scaling
- Test with browser zoom settings at different levels

## Ongoing Maintenance

- Review browser usage statistics quarterly
- Update the browser support policy as needed
- Monitor for new browser versions and features that may impact compatibility
