# Appointment System Testing Plan

## Booking Appointments

### Patient Side
- [ ] Patient can view available providers by specialty
- [ ] Patient can select a date for an appointment
- [ ] Patient can see available time slots for the selected date
- [ ] Patient can successfully book an appointment with required fields (provider, date, time)
- [ ] Patient can add optional notes to an appointment
- [ ] Confirmation is shown after successful booking
- [ ] Appointment appears in the patient's upcoming appointments list

### Provider Side
- [ ] Provider can see all booked appointments on their calendar
- [ ] Provider can see details of appointments when clicked
- [ ] Booked time slots become unavailable for other patients

## Editing Appointments

### Patient Side
- [ ] Patient can see appointment details
- [ ] Patient cannot edit past appointments
- [ ] Patient can reschedule upcoming appointments (if feature is available)
- [ ] Rescheduled appointments reflect correctly in the calendar

### Provider Side
- [ ] Provider can update appointment details (notes, status)
- [ ] Provider can reschedule appointments
- [ ] Changes are immediately reflected in the system
- [ ] Changes appear correctly for patients as well

## Canceling Appointments

### Patient Side
- [ ] Patient can cancel upcoming appointments
- [ ] Confirmation is requested before cancellation
- [ ] Canceled appointments are marked accordingly
- [ ] Canceled time slots become available for rebooking
- [ ] Cancellation notification is sent to the provider

### Provider Side
- [ ] Provider can cancel appointments
- [ ] Provider can mark appointments as "No Show"
- [ ] Provider can provide reason for cancellation
- [ ] Notification is sent to the patient

## Edge Cases
- [ ] System handles concurrent booking attempts for the same slot
- [ ] System properly refreshes availability after bookings/cancellations
- [ ] Appointments display in the correct timezone
- [ ] Past appointments cannot be modified
- [ ] Proper validation of all input fields
- [ ] User receives appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
- [ ] System has proper error handling for API failures

## API and Data Consistency
- [ ] All endpoints use consistent property names (`providerId` instead of `doctorId`)
- [ ] All endpoints use consistent date format (`scheduledFor` instead of `datetime`)
- [ ] API responses include all necessary data for UI rendering
- [ ] Pagination works correctly for appointment lists
- [ ] Filtering and sorting of appointments works properly

## Testing Environment Setup
1. Create test patient accounts
2. Create test provider accounts with different specialties
3. Set up a range of test appointments (past, upcoming, canceled)
4. Prepare data for edge case testing

## Test Execution Procedure
1. Use browser tools to test different viewport sizes
2. Test on multiple devices if possible
3. Document any issues found with screenshots
4. Track issue resolution progress
